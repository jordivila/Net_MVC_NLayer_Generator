.Net MVC NLayered Web Site Generator
====================================

Uses Visual Studio 2013 VSIX to generate a .Net MVC N-Layered site.

The main purpose is to facilitate developers to create scalable web sites or applications that use built-in best practices. 

**VSIX will guide through**:

1.- initialize Membership, Roles, Profiles and Logging databases. 

2.- configure NetTcpBinding or HttpBinding for WCF services. This can be easily changed without recompiling the application.

**Once the application is created you will get an MVC site with**:

1.- WCF Authentication 

2.- Authorization based on User/Roles

3.- Administration zone with user management & logging viewer

4.- User zone with language and jQuery theme management



The solution uses Enterprise Library, Moq and jQuery all of them available as Nuget preinstalled packages.
