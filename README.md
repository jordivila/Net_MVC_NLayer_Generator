Net_MVC_NLayer_Generator
========================

Uses Visual Studio 2010 VSIX to generate a .Net MVC N-Layered site with built-in Authentication, Membership, Roles, Profile and Exception Logging.

The main purpose is to facilitate MVC developers to create new web sites that use built-in best practices. 

This VSIX will guide through : 

1.- initialize Membership, Roles, Profiles and Logging databases. 

2.- configure NetTcpBinding or HttpBinding for WCF services. (This configuration can be easily updated without recompiling the application)
